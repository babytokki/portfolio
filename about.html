    <div class="about-card">
      <p>
        I am a <b>5th-year Computer Science student at Binus University</b> with a passion for
        <b>artificial intelligence</b>, <b>software engineering</b>, and <b>game development</b>.
        My academic journey has allowed me to work on diverse projects ranging from
        <b>web design</b> and <b>AI chatbots</b> to <b>machine learning applications</b>
        and <b>indie game development</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond coursework, I actively participate in the <b>Binus Game Development Club (BGDC)</b>
        and <b>Google Developer Group on Campus</b>, where I’ve collaborated with peers
        on publishing games to Itch.io and organizing community events such as the
        <b>Indienesia Game Festival 2024</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2025, my research paper was accepted at the
        <b>International Conference on Computer Science and Computational Intelligence (ICCSCI)</b>,
        reflecting my dedication to advancing my skills and contributing to the academic community.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am eager to apply my knowledge in real-world settings through internship opportunities,
        where I can contribute to innovative projects while continuing to learn and grow as a developer.
      </p>
